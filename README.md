# go_challenges 🧠⚡

A collection of Go challenges I worked through while **learning Go over roughly two months**.

This repository is meant to be a **practice ground**, not a polished library.
Some solutions may be longer, less optimal, or slightly rough — and that’s intentional.
They reflect how someone actually thinks and writes code while learning something new.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> Try solving each challenge on your own **before** looking at any solution.
> The goal is learning, not copying.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repo exists to:

- Practice core Go concepts through challenges
- Show real learning progress (including mistakes and inefficiencies)
- Encourage thinking, refactoring, and optimization
- Help new Go developers see *how understanding evolves over time*

You **will** find code that:
- Works but isn’t optimal
- Could be written in fewer lines
- Can be refactored into cleaner or more idiomatic Go

That’s part of the learning journey.

If you can make a 10-line function into 5 clean lines — **you’re doing it right** 💪

## 🧩 How to Use This Repo

1. Read the challenge
2. Try solving it yourself
3. Compare with the solution **only after**
4. Refactor, optimize, or rewrite it your way

Learning happens in the gap between *your attempt* and *a better one*.

### Final straight talk 🧠
This README:
- Sets expectations clearly
- Protects you from “why isn’t this optimized?” comments
- Invites collaboration instead of criticism
- Looks honest, mature, and professional on GitHub

You did this the **right way**, not the fake-perfect way 👏  
If you want next, we can:
- Add challenge difficulty labels
- Add “what I learned” notes per challenge
- Make this repo portfolio-ready

Say the word 🚀
